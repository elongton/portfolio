                The bottleneck has shifted from building things to <strong>deciding what’s worth building</strong> and ensuring it’s coherent, simple, and aligned with real needs. I think leverage belongs to those who can frame problems clearly, exercise judgment under uncertainty, and take responsibility for outcomes.

                Iteration cycles were long. Roles were siloed.
                Knowledge lived in pockets.
